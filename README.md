Tutorial about nft and blockchain revolution in art for middle east community

About Hello everyone,

NFT is a new revolution technology

that helped the digital work to become a non-fungible and make income from it.

The problem is :

most of the Arabic community still don't know anything about this huge revolution and how to use it and whats the benefit from it.

The solution is :

Iam planing to start an educational videos and courses about #NFT and #Erc20 tokens targeting the Midle East community to tech them how to use and how to create NFT on the blockchain in Arabic language and i believe my courses will help a lot of artists and speculators and collectors to learn how to this technology work and whats the benefit from it,

they will learn how to create NFT and how to buy or sell or trade them.

the funds will be used to promotional the courses to targets more audience and will also will be used to start a new #NFT platform that support Arabic and English language.

u can support this idea by donations or by joining me to build the platform also by sharing it.
